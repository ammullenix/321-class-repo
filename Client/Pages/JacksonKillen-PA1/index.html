    <h3 id="basic-info">About Me</h3>
    <p>
    I am originally from Rome, GA. I moved to Tuscaloosa to pursue a degree at the University of Alabama. 
    I originally began in Computer Science but switched to Management Information Systems (MIS) after meeting 
    several people who were very passionate about the program here.

  <div class="mb-4">
    <h3 id="work-history">Work History</h3>
    <p>
    I recently completed an internship with Afflink here in Tuscaloosa, where I gained valuable experience 
    providing IT support and assisting with day-to-day technical operations. This role allowed me to strengthen 
    my problem-solving skills and develop a deeper understanding of how technology supports business processes.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-3">
    In addition to my internship, I currently serve as a Network Communications Specialist in the Alabama National Guard. 
    In this position, I work with secure communication systems and networking equipment, building both technical 
    proficiency and leadership skills while supporting mission-critical operations.
  </p>
  <div class="mb-4">
    <h3 id="work-interests">Work Interests</h3>
    <p> I enjoy working with communications and networking, whether in the classroom, 
    during my internship, or through my role in the Army National Guard. 
    Iâ€™m interested in how reliable networks and clear communication 
    can make both everyday operations and larger projects run smoothly.</p>
