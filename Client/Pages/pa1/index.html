                <p>I'm very interested in cybersecurity and data analytics because both fields challenge me to think critically and solve problems in different ways. Cybersecurity appeals to me because it focuses on protecting systems and staying ahead of various threats, while data analytics excites me for the way it uncovers patterns and insights that assist with decision making. </p>

                <h2 class="h1 fw-bold mb-4">Experience</h2>
                <p>In the summer of 2025, I co-founded HorizonFrame through the Crimson Entrepreneurship Academy, where I helped develop and launch a mobile application that is now available on the Apple App Store. This experience allowed me to gain practical insight into product design, development, and deployment while working in a fast-paced, startup environment. Currently, I work as an AV Technician with Audio Visual Solutions at the University of Alabama, where I support instructional technology across campus. In this role, I install new PCs in faculty offices and classrooms, provide on-call technical support for computers and AV systems during live classes, and quickly diagnose hardware and connectivity issues to ensure reliable classroom operations. These experiences have strengthened both my technical and problem-solving skills, while also teaching me the importance of adaptability and teamwork. In addition, I have built a strong technical foundation with skills in C#, Microsoft Windows, and macOS, as well as experience using tools such as Visual Studio, Microsoft Excel, Canva, Windsurf, and Figma.</p>
