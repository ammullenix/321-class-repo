      MY PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

          Most recently, I worked as a Student Assistant in the IT department at
          Gorgas Library, where I supported system maintenance, troubleshooting, and
          student/faculty technology needs. That role strengthened my technical
          problem-solving skills and taught me how to work closely with a wide range
          of users.

          Before that, I collaborated with Manojavaya Retailers in Montgomery, where
          I built a front-end solution with HTML and CSS, added backend
          functionality in JavaScript, and managed a SQL database to help track
          payments and avoid missed vendor deadlines. This experience gave me
          hands-on exposure to software development and business problem-solving.

    <p class="font-monospace fs-4 fst-italic">
      I also gained customer service experience at Raising
      Caneâ€™s, where I worked as a cashier and supported mobile ordering systems. I
      improved customer wait times by coordinating with kitchen staff and
      resolving minor technical issues, which taught me the importance of
      communication and teamwork.
